# Remember Notes
  #### A module for Foundry VTT
  Do you prefer taking session notes on google docs or need to pull up many reference links to game rules during your game? This module is here to help remind you to open all of these things and keep all your links and reminders in one place.
  
  "Remember Notes" module adds a feature where each user who connects to the game world can store a memo with notes or links. They can set this memo to popup on connecting to the game world.
  
  On a per-user basis, configure a journal entry to pop-up on logging in to foundry to remind you to read over and take notes during your session.
  
  
  #### *Status*
  UI is written, data storage for individual memos. 
  Still need to add popup flag on each user and hook data manipulation to the UI.
